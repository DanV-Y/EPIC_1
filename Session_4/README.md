This class is an introduction to image analysis of biological images (i.e. microscopy images).
Basic knowledge in Python and Jupyter is required.

### 0. Preliminar information

- Please create a local copy of the code and required files by cloning the repository:
$ git clone https://github.com/ciencialatitud0/EPIC_1.git

- If you use Google Colab (see https://colab.research.google.com/):
	- Upload the notebooks and the image data (tiffs and jpgs)
- With Anaconda/Miniconda (follow the instrctuions from the preliminary activities):
	- Activate the environment:
 	$ conda activate py37	
 	- Install a few extra libraries:
 	$ conda install scipy scikit-image tifffile
 	- Open a jupyter notebook
 	$ jupyter notebook

### 1. Introduction to Digital Images
- Brief intro to digital images

### 2. BioImage Analysis with Python

- It is a step by step pipeline for segmenting cells in 2D fluorescence microscopy images (with labeled membranes)
