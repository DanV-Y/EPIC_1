Examples

# Day 2 (19/10/2021)

## Session 3: Data Analysis with python II
Introduction to HDF5, VTK, and Binary Data Formats<br />
Reading and handling data from numerical simulations<br />
Array manipulation, and use of conditionals and loops<br />
Application to the analysis of 2D simulations of fluid dynamics<br />
Computation of integrated quantities<br />
Clump finding techniques<br />
Visualisation and interpretation of the results

# Day 3 (20//10/2021):
Parallel sessions on advanced topics.

## Session 4: Image processing:
Explanation about bioimages (i.e. fluorescence microscopy)<br />
Bioimage analysis example: quantifying cell morphology from 2D fluorescence micrographs<br />
Importing images and plotting images<br />
Logical operators (pixel-wise operations)<br />
Intensity Transformation<br />
Filters and Fourier transformations<br />
Segmentation<br />
Extracting data from segmented images (e.g. cell area, elongation)

## Session 5: Particle physics:
Brief intro to data analysis for high energy physics<br />
The exercise requires basic knowledge of LHC physics data.<br />
How to handle it, how to process it and what to look up to.<br />
This exercise uses real data from one of the LHC experiments.<br /><br />
Filter the data, make relevant plots and statistically analyze the results.

# Day 4 (21//10/2021):

## Session 6: Materials science:
Explanation.
i) Mixed quantum/classical method: Trajectory surface hopping (TSH).
ii) Tully models and their link with some model systems nonadiabatic dynamics.
Computing Verlet velocity algorithm and surface hopping between two states.
Plotting time trace of position, velocity, relative energies, and population (between the ground state and first excited state).

## Session 7: Astrophysics (session in English):
Brief explanation on astrophysics behind galaxies and their neutral hydrogen (HI content).<br />
Reading in fits data cubes (3D spectral line data - HI data of a galaxy)<br />
Plotting slices of the 3D data cube and making moment maps<br />
Downloading astronomical images from a database (for the same galaxy as the HI data)<br />
Making an overlay of the HI data onto an optical image<br />
Calculating some basic statistics for the spectra<br />
Averaging the spectra for the galaxy<br />
Calculating the HI mass of a galaxy<br />
Fitting a Gaussian to spectra
