Regressions and curve fitting<br />
Examples

# Day 2 (19/10/2021)

## Session 3: Data Analysis with python II (9:00 - 13:00)
Introduction to HDF5, VTK, and Binary Data Formats<br />
Reading and handling data from numerical simulations<br />
Array manipulation, and use of conditionals and loops<br />
Application to the analysis of 2D simulations of fluid dynamics<br />
Computation of integrated quantities<br />
Clump finding techniques<br />
Visualisation and interpretation of the results

# Day 3 (20//10/2021):
Parallel sessions on advanced topics.

## Session 4: Image processing (9:00 - 13:00)
Explanation about bioimages (i.e. fluorescence microscopy)<br />
Bioimage analysis example: quantifying cell morphology from 2D fluorescence micrographs<br />
Importing images and plotting images<br />
Logical operators (pixel-wise operations)<br />
Intensity Transformation<br />
Filters and Fourier transformations<br />
Segmentation<br />
Extracting data from segmented images (e.g. cell area, elongation)

## Session 5: Particle physics (9:00 - 13:00)
Brief intro to data analysis for high energy physics<br />
The exercise requires basic knowledge of LHC physics data.<br />
How to handle it, how to process it and what to look up to.<br />
This exercise uses real data from one of the LHC experiments.<br />
Filter the data, make relevant plots and statistically analyze the results.

Magnetic simulations


## Session 8: Astrophysics (session in English, 9:00 - 13:00):
Brief explanation on astrophysics behind galaxies and their neutral hydrogen (HI content).<br />
Reading in fits data cubes (3D spectral line data - HI data of a galaxy)<br />
Plotting slices of the 3D data cube and making moment maps<br />
Downloading astronomical images from a database (for the same galaxy as the HI data)<br />
Making an overlay of the HI data onto an optical image<br />
Calculating some basic statistics for the spectra<br />
Averaging the spectra for the galaxy<br />
Calculating the HI mass of a galaxy<br />
Fitting a Gaussian to spectra
