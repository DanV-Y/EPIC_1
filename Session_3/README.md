This class is an introduction to data analysis of gas dynamics simulations. The main objective is to use concepts from thermal physics and fluid dynamics to understand the evolution of turbulence in ideal compressible gases. To achieve this goal, we will:

A. first revise basic concepts of thermodynamics,


B. look at examples of gas dynamics simulations and data formats used in computational fluid dynamics,


C. and analyse datasets of Eulerian simulations of 2D turbulence.


D. After we finish the class, you will work on some exercises based on the items above.
