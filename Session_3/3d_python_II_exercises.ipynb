    "\n",
    " - The pressure of the plasma permeating the Solar corona. How does it compare to Earth's atmospheric pressure at the sea level? The number density of the Solar corona is $n=10^9\\,\\rm cm^{-3}$ and its temperature is $T=2\\times 10^6\\,\\rm K$.\n",

    " - The polytropic index of carbon-monoxide (CO) gas. Hint: Get the degrees of freedom first.\n",

    "\n",
    " - The mean particle mass (mean molecular weight) of air in our atmosphere (remember Nytrogen is the most abundant element). Once calculated, add it to the phase diagram $T$ vs. $\\mu$ shown in class. How does the value compare to that of atomic hydrogen?\n",
